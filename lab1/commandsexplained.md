For the command cd, when no argument was inputted it printed out nothing. This is because the command cd changes your directory towards the directory that you put in. When I put in cd messages it forwarded me toward the messages directory and when I put in cd Hello.java it returned an error. This is because it could not forward me to a directory since Hello.java is a file.

The command ls shows you what is in your directory. When I ran ls with no arguments it showed me that messages were a directory in my file since it is highlighted in green. When I ran ls with the argument "messages" it showed me the three contents of this directory. Lastly, when I ran ls with the argument "Hello.java" it just printed out Hello.java since this is already a file.

The command cat reads out the contents in a file. When I run cat with no arguments it prints nothing since I didn't provide a file to read. When I do cat messages, this is an error since messages is a directory, not a file and it cant read and print out what is in it. Finally, when I do cat Hello.java it can print out the text in the file Hello.java
